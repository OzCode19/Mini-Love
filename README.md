# Mini Love

Mini Love is a tiny browser game where you click floating hearts while avoiding broken ones.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Choose your gender, read the instructions, and try to score as many hearts as possible in 30 seconds.

## Development

Game styles live in `style.css`, and the JavaScript logic is in `script.js`. Feel free to tweak these files to customize the game.
